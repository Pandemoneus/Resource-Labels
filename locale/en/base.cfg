resource-labels-show-labels=If checked, display the resource name next to the resource icon.\n\nDefault: false
resource-labels-cooldown=The cooldown time in ticks that has to pass before players of a force can calculate labels again. This setting is mainly for server admins to prevent players from lagging the server.\n\nDefault: 60, Minimum: 0
resource-labels-show-resource-count=If checked, show the resource count next to the resource icon.\n\nDefault: false
